The Los Angeles native claimed that when he walked into a local deli, he was met with hostility when he asked for a “scooped, gluten-free” bagel, which runs rather contrary to the chilled-out bagel service that he was accustomed to on the West Coast.&nbsp;</p><p>Let me backup and define what a “scooped bagel” even is: It’s a regular bagel with most of its fluffy innards removed, creating two hollowed discs. The argument for some people to order a scooped bagel&nbsp;is to either make room for more toppings, or to remove a few extra calories from your morning deli order.&nbsp;</p><p>Though Offer tells his story with a smile, since uploading the video he and all the scooped-bagel lovers of the world have been facing backlash from every corner of the internet. From commenters claiming to be “team bagel shop” and calling the order a “crime” to people straight-up calling for border control in New York state to weed out carb-averse Californians, it’s safe to say that a scooped bagel is a less than savory choice.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>In my opinion, this is an over dramatic yet very fair reaction. The concept of the scooped bagel is also lost on me. The fluffy interior is the best part — why ask the server to do the extra unnecessary arm work to remove it? Why make an already risky gluten-free bagel even less structurally sound? I’ll also echo other commentators and ask: Why not just order something else?&nbsp;</p><p>As&nbsp; someone who used to work customer service, what’s extra satisfying about this little debacle are all the people calling out scooped bagel guy’s entitlement. Though I really do think Offer meant well, I wholeheartedly disagree with the phrase “the customer is always right,” because a lot of the time they’re wrong — very wrong. No one is entitled to the thing that they want just simply because they want it, even a scooped gluten-free bagel. While it may seem absurd to refuse service just over differing tastes, this worker was well within their rights to turn away a fussy, unnecessary order on a stressful day.&nbsp;</p><p>The&nbsp; thing that stumped me the most, as an Angeleno myself, was Offer’s claim that scooped bagels are not only commonplace but celebrated in the city. Don’t get me wrong, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Los Angeles bagels</a> are nowhere near the caliber of New York’s, I can admit that. However, this video going viral further propagates the myth that Californians wouldn’t know a good bagel if it smacked them between the eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>With one of the biggest Jewish populations in the country, and an exciting <a href=#>bagel boom</a> of late, I would consider Los Angeles bagels to even be a bagel destination, with places new and established to choose from.&nbsp;</p><p>While it’s tempting to lambast this naive user and call him a stereotypical health nut, don’t take&nbsp; the rest of Los Angeles or its local bagel enjoyers down with it. I believe in the right to choose: If this man or anyone else wants to eat a really sad scooped bagel, let them. Just don’t expect to order it in NYC without getting a bit of a tongue-lashing, respectfully.</p><h3 class=m-newsletter__heading>Join Our Newsletter</h3><p>Love Jewish food?
