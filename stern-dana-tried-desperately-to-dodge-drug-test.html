Obviously, we don’t have to test it now,” Stern said.</p><p>“We had a lot of deception going on, I think.”</p><p>Authorities believe Plato’s death in Oklahoma was accidental, although a probe was continuing.</p><p>Stern’s bombshell came as several callers – and the mother of Todd Bridges, Plato’s TV co-star – blamed Stern for possibly driving her over the edge.</p><p>“After going on his show maybe she thought, ‘I need to take a Valium to calm me down because people think I’m on drugs,'” Betty Bridges told The Post.</p><p>“If you’re not taking drugs and they’re saying you are, then you’re tripping out. She’s very sensitive.”</p><p>Bridges suggested Plato turned to drugs after her mom, Kay, died in the 1980s of a blood disease that resulted in the amputation of her arms and legs.</p><p>Stern said he didn’t feel any blame, insisting Plato seemed to be enjoying herself on his show.</p><p>“Maybe we gave her her last good time. She thanked me afterward. She was sweet, very nice,” he said.</p><p>Meanwhile, Todd Bridges told TV’s “Inside Edition,” “I thought something was wrong … I was hoping I was wrong … You could see it on Dana’s face that she was hurting and she needed a lot of help.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Fuhnp7j25mamlfqMGmvs1mm5qmkWLBs7XEnWSdnaOlsrOt056jsmWkpHqlu8OgnGacoqq0bsDErKto</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
