Ogawa attend the world premiere of Netflix’s “Wednesday” – @Getty</p><p>Wednesday is a US comedy horror series on Netflix, which acts as a spinoff of the Adam’s Family.</p><p>Rather than focusing on the entire family, as was the case with the various movies, TV shows, and cartoons, the show instead focuses on the character Wednesday Addams, who is played brilliantly by Jenna Ortega.</p><p>Fans first started to take note of the show when they learned that gothic horror directing legend Tim Burton would be on board as an executive producer, and a director, directing four out of the first season’s eight episodes.</p><p>Tim Burton came close to directing 1991’s Addam’s Family movie and was a huge fan of the premise.</p><p>He was involved in a 2009 stop-motion animated movie based on The Addams Family, though that was canceled, much to the dismay of fans.</p><p>Wednesday is a show that centers on Wednesday Addams being expelled from her high school after she dumps a heap of piranhas into the boy’s water polo swimming pool after she finds out that they were bullying her brother Pugsley.</p><p>Her parents, Gomez and Morticia Addams, enroll her at their old school ‘Nevermore Academy.’</p><p>The academy is a private school made exclusively for outcasts, monsters, and the socially excluded.</p><p>Wednesday is a cold and emotionless young woman who struggles to connect with other students at the academy.</p><p>She regularly clashes with the school’s principal and discovers she has psychic abilities.</p><p>As she settles in, she begins to let her guard down and bond with the other students.</p><p>One such student is Eugene Ottinger, who has a relatively small, yet very important role in the show.</p><h3><strong>Who is Eugene Ottinger?</strong></h3><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-76113 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/does-eugene-die-in-wednesday.jpg.webp alt="does eugene die in wednesday" width=800 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/does-eugene-die-in-wednesday.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-2 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-76113 class=wp-caption-text>Moosa Mostafa attends the “Lockwood & Co” Special Screening at The Courthouse Hotel – @Getty</p><p>If you’re wondering, does Eugene die in Wednesday? We’ll get to that shortly.</p><p>Before we do, however, we need to look at the character of Eugene to discover why he is so popular and so likable.</p><p>Played by Moosa Mostafa, Eugene is a socially awkward, shy, geeky, and misunderstood student at the Nevermore Academy.</p><p>He, like Wednesday, possesses psychic abilities and possesses the ability to control bees with his mind.</p><p>Eugene is the president of the academy’s beekeeping club and is one of the school’s most quirky and misunderstood characters. Eugene is one of the unpopular kids and has a lot in common with Wednesday Addams.</p><p>As season one progresses, the two begin to grow closer and strike up a very wholesome friendship.</p><p>Eugene is a shy and geeky character who strikes up a friendship with Wednesday.</p><p>While that is all their relationship is, Eugene does develop a bit of a crush on Wednesday and picks up romantic feelings for his friend.</p><p>The school is located in the town of Jericho, Vermont, and with all kinds of ghostly and spooky goings on, Eugene and Wednesday find themselves in the midst of the Jericho Monster Hunt.</p><p>The two have great chemistry on-screen, and Eugene is one of the show’s most popular characters.</p><p>Because of this, however, Eugene does find himself in peril, and fans of the show have been concerned for his future and his safety. But does Eugene die in Wednesday?</p><p>Well, we’re going to attempt to get to the truth shortly.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-76115 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/does-eugene-die-in-wednesday-addams-1.jpg.webp alt="does eugene die in wednesday addams" width=800 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/does-eugene-die-in-wednesday-addams-1.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-3 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-76115 class=wp-caption-text>Moosa Mostafa and guest attend the world premiere of Netflix’s “Wednesday” at Hollywood Legion Theater – @Getty</p><h2><strong>Does Eugene die in Wednesday?</strong></h2><p>Needless to say, if you’ve got this far, you still don’t know Eugene’s fate. If you wish to keep it that way, we recommend that you stop reading and go find something else to do. If, however, the suspense is too much for you and you can’t take it any longer and need to learn the truth about Eugene’s fate, all will soon become clear.</p><p>Because Eugene is such a likable character, many fans of his character grew concerned for his safety, especially after being caught up in the Jericho Monster hunt. But is Eugene safe, or is he sadly no more?</p><p>Well, as of this writing, we can exclusively reveal that Eugene does NOT die in Wednesday, at least, not in season one. So, if you’re wondering does Eugene die in Wednesday, you can now breathe a sigh of relief. Or can you?</p><p>Even though Eugene does not die, he does suffer a nasty fate and does slip into a coma. Does he pull through, or will he pull through? That’s for you to find out in season 2.</p><h2 style=text-align:center><strong>READ THIS NEXT:</strong></h2><p style=text-align:center><a href=#>Who is Michael Mando’s wife</a>?</p><p style=text-align:center><a href=#>How Much Does Elon Musk Make a Second</a>?</p><p style=text-align:center><a href=#>Does Rob Gronkowski have any kids</a>?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2FPnqappJWpvKWt2GeaqKVfmbymv4yerKCdnpp6pbXEZqCnZaeasa%2Bx0p2YsmWRmbGiudJo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
