Lo debuted at No. 1 on the pop charts, while her film, the romantic comedy The Wedding Planner, shot to the top spot at the box office in its first week of release. In December 2002, she delivered another one-two punch with the release of the record This Is Me ... Then and a starring role in the comedy Maid in Manhattan, which was a box office hit, if not a critical one.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2003, Lopez co-starred with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/ben-affleck data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ben Affleck" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ben Affleck</a> in the box office bomb Gigli.

In December 1999, Combs and Lopez were allegedly involved in a shooting incident outside a New York City nightclub, in which three people were injured. Combs was later charged with gun possession and bribery, as prosecutors claimed he offered his driver, Wardel Fenderson, $50,000 to say that the loaded gun police found at the scene of the crime was Fenderson's. Combs was acquitted of all charges, and soon confirmed that he and Lopez had separated.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Cris Judd</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Shortly after that breakup was made public, Lopez began dating Cris Judd, a dancer who appeared in the video for her hit single "Love Don't Cost a Thing."

She found musical success again later that same year with Brave. While the title track received some attention, Lopez's personal life generated more media interest: Once known for her revealing fashions, Lopez started wearing loose-fitting tops, creating speculation about whether she was pregnant. Many photos of her seemed to show a "baby bump," but the official announcement didn't come until November 7, 2007.</p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Kids</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Lopez gave birth to twins February 22, 2008.
