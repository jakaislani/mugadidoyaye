You see, the group not only floundered during the marooning contest, but they had to contend with the mud-covered humiliation of coming out at the bottom rung of the ladder-focused immunity challenge. Lulu‚Äôs last-place status in the contest inevitably put them on the chopping block for Tribal Council.</p><h2 id=h-who-was-the-first-person-to-get-kicked-off-of-survivor-45-s-debut-episode data-injectable=false>Who was the first person to get kicked off of Survivor 45‚Äôs debut episode?</h2><p lang=en dir=ltr>Nothing like the first tribal of the season!ü§© <a href=#>#Survivor</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/dlwh7ph2lL</a></p>‚Äî SURVIVOR (@survivorcbs) <a href=#>September 28, 2023</a><p data-characters=423 data-current-count=423 data-injectable=true>The compounding losses just days into the competition that involves physical challenges in the Mamanuca Islands in Fiji and far from a traditional feathery bed to sink one‚Äôs head into proved way too much for one Lulu tribe member, Hannah Rose.
