You can truly put whatever you want on it. So please explain to me why I am surprised and delighted every time DiGiorno deigns to bestow a new innovation upon us. They are just so good at knowing what delicious pizza innovation should grace our freezers next. A week ago, did I think I needed a Thanksgiving pizza? Absolutely not. I didn’t even know what day it was, let alone what I wanted to eat for dinner. But now that I know this is a thing I want it. I want it like a kid wants shiny things, unconditional love, and dino nuggets and, gosh darn it, I’m going to go get it this month. <a href=# rel=noopener>DiGiorno Thanksgiving Pizza</a> will be the subject of my cuffing season.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-exactly-is-digiorno-thanksgiving-pizza-is-this-a-thanksgiving-appetizer-a-thanksgiving-feast-for-one-or-a-way-for-digiorno-employees-to-get-rid-of-their-leftovers>What exactly is DiGiorno Thanksgiving Pizza? Is this a Thanksgiving appetizer, a Thanksgiving feast for one, or a way for DiGiorno employees to get rid of their leftovers?</h2><p>Well, like most things in life this pizza is what you make of it. It can be a <a href=#>Thanksgiving appetizer</a>, a <a href=#>Thanksgiving feast for one</a>—or just regular ol’ dinner on a chilly weeknight in November. As for what it is, it would seem this cozy ‘za consists of a “Detroit style crust topped with turkey, gravy sauce, diced sweet potatoes, green beans, cranberries, mozzarella cheese and cheddar cheese.” DiGiorno suggests you use it as a Thanksgiving side or bring it to a Friendsgiving, but I say live your best life and eat your holiday pizza wherever, whenever, and with whomever you want. I will be enjoying this pizza in a box, with a fox, as that is canonically where people seem to eat unusual foods.</p><p>Now you may be thinking, “Alright amazing love it, love the concept—how do I get my hands on this stuff?” It’s not as easy as going to the store—it’s even easier! This pizza is now <a href=# rel=noopener>available exclusively through DiGiorno’s website for $</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">11.23</a> and for a limited time only. How limited? We don’t know, so if you want to try this unconventional Turkey Day pie, head over to their site and order away. Ironically, this will mean you will be having DiGiorno delivered to you, which just might break the very fabric of this universe, so be careful and if any wormholes open up, just stay away and eat your pizza, you’ll probably be fine.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJyZnLawvs2oZK2gkaO4tLPIr6Cnn12ltrvGwGalnq%2BjZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
