In our efforts to find the best plant based meatballs, we wanted something that replicated everything we know and love about regular meatballs.</p><p>We gathered as many plant-based meatballs as we could find to put together an ultimate vegan meatball taste test. After veggie burgers, vegetarian meatballs have the widest range of variety when it comes to taste, texture, and price points.</p><p>Below are the plant-based meatballs we think could impress even the toughest critics (aka Italian grandmas).

In the end, these Beyond meatballs reigned supreme. Multiple members of the Sporked team agreed that they would think these were made with real meat if they didn’t know otherwise. These look and taste like meat. There’s a nice bouncy texture. They’re lightly seasoned and have a strong savory, meaty umami-ness. I would definitely buy these for my future spaghetti dinners.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>10/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/plant-based-meatballs_inset-02-reduced.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Seasoning</p><strong>Impossible Homestyle Meatballs</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>I absolutely love the flavor of these Impossible plant-based meatballs. They are so filled with seasoning, including a rich oniony flavor that reminds me of a White Castle burger patty. I know that sounds weird, but it’s a good thing! Trust me! Their texture is so close to real meat, it might gross out a vegan. To me, they have the perfect mouthfeel. These were my personal number one and I have already bought them again for my own personal use since this taste test.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>10/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/plant-based-meatballs_inset-03-reduced.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Most Unique</p><strong>Hungry Planet PorkThai Meatballs</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walmart</a><p>When I think of plant-based meatballs, I think of Italian-style meatballs you’d serve with pasta and tomato sauce. But meatballs are popular all over the world, so why shouldn’t plant-based meatballs represent that? These Hungry Planet Thai Sausage Meatballs are the perfect pork-themed vegan meatball. They are gingery and fresh. They’re super juicy. I would be thrilled to have a banh mi stuffed with these, or enjoy them as a vegetarian version of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">lion’s head meatballs</a>.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/plant-based-meatballs_inset-04-reduced.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Budget</p><strong>Earth Grown Vegan Classic Meatless Meatballs</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Aldi</a><p>Aldi makes delicious and affordable plant-based meatballs. Their Earth Grown Vegan Classic Meatless Meatballs are very plant-y in a good way. By that, I mean you can tell they aren’t made of meat. That doesn’t matter, though! They’re delicious. They’re super savory and salty. They’re so tender. I would recommend these for vegans who don’t want a meatball. These are plantballs, and delicious plantballs at that! If you’re shopping at Aldi, throw these in your cart.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/plant-based-meatballs_inset-05-reduced.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Italian</p><strong>Gardein Plant-Based Meatballs</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walmart</a><p>I was pleasantly surprised by these Gardein Plant-Based Meatballs. They feel very intentionally seasoned. By that, I mean they don’t just taste like “meat” or “savory.” They taste like fennel seed and black pepper. They taste like real meatballs an Italian grandmother would make. They’re not quite as moist as some of the other vegan meatballs we tried, so I would load these up on a hoagie roll with tons of marinara and provolone cheese.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/meatball-inset-06-reduced.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Classic</p><strong>MorningStar Farms Veggie Meatballs</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Ralph’s</a><p>I heated these up in the microwave for our taste test and they came out crispy after cooking for about a minute. It is so rare to find a product that can actually get crispy in the microwave. I was thrilled these did. On top of a nice exterior crust, they have a wonderful meaty texture. The flavor is umami-forward and mushroomy. MorningStar Farms products are always on sale at Target, so grab a bag of these the next time you’re grocery shopping.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Morningstar Farms</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><p><strong>Other Products We Tried:</strong> Earth Grown Italian Meatless Meatballs, IKEA Plant Based Balls, FarmRich Garden Inspirations Plant Based Meatballs</p><p class="has-light-purple-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><strong>S</strong>hare your favorite veggie meatballs with us using #SporkedTasteTest for a chance to be featured on our social pages!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFuvMuapa1lkpbAprCMppyarJKWua2%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
