And I was able to share that with my high school sweetheart, a woman I truly loved, and to be me. I never had to act.”</p><p class=Fg>Although his wish of growing old with Gina didn't happen, he accepted Gina's request to separate. The couple shared two children, Shelbi, 23, and Spenser, 29.</p><p class=Fg>Now, Neely has since moved on and is married to Tamika Parks and he claims it was "love at first sight".</p><p class=Fg>The two co-parent Tamika's 5-year-old son from another relationship, and their daughter, Eriel, 3 months.</p><p class=Fg>While he kept his relationship under wraps in the past few years, he is now ready to share his beautiful family to the world, especially since he is set to head back to work next year as a culinary consultant for an Atlanta-based franchise called "This Is It!
