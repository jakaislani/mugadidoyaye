She stated:</p><p>“Treason is a traditional espionage program in some aspects, but it’s also a family drama in others. And I guess what I enjoy about it is that it delves into what it’s like to be a spy in the upper offices of MI6. As a result, the kids, Ella and Callum, play an important role. Then there’s Maddy, Adam’s wife, and she’s one of the most lovely and compassionate characters I’ve ever portrayed.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Oona-Chaplin-2.jpg alt="Oona Chaplin" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The actress went on to say:</p><p>“Her capacity for love is enormous. As an example, she has adopted Charlie’s children. They’re adult children, but the way she loves and cares for them and is really, truly there for them in really deep and significant ways motivated me to learn from that character.”</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGimqKaRYrCprc%2BloKdlmah6sbvRramasZWZeqK%2FjJpkppmUmcZusMRmmqirpJZ6qrqMramemaOku3A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
