I've always believed that it takes 3-4 years to prove yourself as a Shield batsman, and Langer has achieved that. He is more of a grafting batsman than any of his rivals and that should definitely count in his favour, given the current state of Australian batting. He probably doesn't have as much natural ability as some others around, but he has proved that he can make best use of what he has got. He's prepared to work hard, and has tightened his game a lot since he came into first class cricket. His ability to get his head down and his tight defence will both be strong assets in England.</p><h2>Biography/Timeline</h2><span>1973</span><p>Langer made his first class debut in 1973-74 for West <a href=#>Australia</a> against New Zealand, scoring 42 and 20.</p><span>1974</span><p>He began the 1974-75 season well with 41 not out and 66 against South <a href=#>Australia</a> and 62 against the touring <a href=#>English</a> side.
