This is a super interesting new product from Country Crock, whose main gig is margarine of all kinds.</p><p>I was intrigued to learn that Country Crock even had a plant-based line of margarine because I somehow thought margarine was a vegan, vegetable oil-based product to begin with. Well, I thought wrong. Apparently, all Country Crock products <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">contain dairy</a> except the ones specifically in their plant-based line. Huh. What is margarine again? Anyway, back to the scheduled program: vegan heavy whipping cream. Now you may be thinking, “Wait a minute, doesn’t vegan heavy whipping cream already exist?” And you would have a point, you food sleuth, you.&nbsp;</p><p>Silk (the alt milk brand) also has a vegan plant-based heavy whipping cream. Silk’s is faba bean-based while Country Crock’s is lentil-based. In other words, this world just got more <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">bean cream</a>! And here’s a cool factoid for you: Neither <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Silk’s version</a> nor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Country Crock’s version</a> contain any soy. So that is cool if you’re allergic (or just not a soy boy, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">unlike Link</a>).</p><p>But here’s a question: How do they make a plant-based whipping cream “heavy”? It’s made of plants for gosh sakes! Wouldn’t it be light and planty? Well, the answer is in the oils, my friend. I would bet this stuff whips up to a Cool Whip-like consistency, as Cool Whip is the primarily oil-based margarine of the whipped cream world. But I don’t actually know for sure! Next time I have my vegan friends over maybe I’ll attempt a vegan pumpkin pie with some of this plant-based heavy whipping cream. Or, maybe just fruit with&nbsp; plant-based heavy whipping cream. As long as fruit is plant-based, we are good to go… I’d better go double-check that one.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaKiclru1ecKrnJqlXauyqK3NZq6hoaCltq%2BzjJypnpmdYrumw9Jo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
