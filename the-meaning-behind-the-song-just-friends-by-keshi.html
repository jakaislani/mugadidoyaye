The protagonist wonders if their intimacy goes beyond friendship, especially when they engage in physical intimacy. The uncertainty is evident in lines like “If we fuckin’, are we just friends?” and “If he leaves your room, are you just friends?” These questions reveal the protagonist’s desire for more than just a platonic bond.</p><p>In the verse, keshi brings up the conflicting emotions that one experiences when their feelings are dismissed or not reciprocated. The narrator is willing to throw away their own feelings for the sake of maintaining the friendship. They express the willingness to accept heartbreak and still desire to have the other person in their life. The lines “Fuckin’ wreck my heart, I’ll take you back” and “If I can’t have you, no one can” highlight the lengths the protagonist is willing to go to keep this person close, even if it means sacrificing their own happiness.</p><p>The song concludes with the repetition of the phrase “Say it ain’t so,” expressing the protagonist’s hope that the other person feels the same way and that their connection goes beyond friendship. This plea is filled with both desperation and longing, reflecting the emotional rollercoaster one experiences in such situations.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Personal_Experience_with_the_Song></span>Personal Experience with the Song<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>“just friends” by keshi resonates with me on a deeply personal level.
