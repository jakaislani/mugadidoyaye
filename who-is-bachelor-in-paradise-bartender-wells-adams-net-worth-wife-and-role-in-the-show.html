Though he departed in week six, this is actually where his bartending began. He shared with Joe Vulpis on Lightweight Podcast that during week one of The Bachelorette, he began making drinks for himself and other bachelors who already had roses and werenâ€™t getting any screentime. He said that it started to catch on and getting a rose had double the benefits: They were one step closer to JoJoâ€™s heart and they got to get drunk with Wells.</p><p data-characters=407 data-current-count=407 data-injectable=true>Because of this, Wells took over the role of the bartender in Season 4 of Bachelor in Paradise and spent three blissful seasons making drinks and stirring up drama safely behind his bar. However, after former host Chris Harrison departed from the show, Wells was given a bigger role on the beach. In Season 7 he graduated from bartender to master of rose ceremonies, while continuing to bartend, of course.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Wells Adams (@wellsadams)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=570 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Cosmopolitan</a>, this role has allowed him to make upwards of $500 thousand per season and reports his net worth as $400 thousand, which is also supplemented by the many brand deals he posts on his Instagram and his pizza-making competition show Best in Dough.</p><p data-characters=581 data-current-count=581 data-injectable=true>On top of that, his time with Bachelor Nation helped him score his wife of one year â€” Sarah Hyland â€” who is famous for playing Haley Dunphy on the hit sitcom Modern Family. She also recently became the host of Love Island: USA. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People reports</a> that Wells first caught her attention when he was on The Bachelorette and she put out some serious Twitter flirtations throughout his time on both The Bachelorette and BIP.
