The singer recently erased his family photographs, wife and videos from his account and temporarily changed his bio to say “Separated and Single.” This led fans to speculate about an upcoming divorce.</p><p>His marriage to his wife, Princess Love, played out in front of the cameras on the reality show “Love and Hip Hop: Hollywood.” The couple married in 2016 after being together for two years. Love and the singer had two children before she filed for a divorce in 2020, the same year the two appeared on VH1’s “Couples Retreat.” Love and Ray J also appeared on “The Conversation: Ray J & Princess Love.”</p><p>Love withdrew her petition for divorce only for Ray J to file for a divorce in September of that year. He later withdrew his petition for divorce and the couple again reconciled. The divorce was officially called off in March 2021.</p><p>No official announcement about the couple breaking up has been made, but one thing is definitely permanent. He will always have his big sister and best friend, Brandy, on his arm.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX9ye5BpZmlrX6mutXnMsmSnmZ2aerC6jLKmrmWjpHqqecqnprBlmanAbr7EmqNmmqKWu6XFjKucrKifo7G0edOoZKuZqWK3brPErauippditaa%2BjKeYpp1dqa61wM6onJ1ln6N6qbXMaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
