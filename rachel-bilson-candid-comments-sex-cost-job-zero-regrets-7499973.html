All because she gave her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>honest opinion on sex</a> two weeks ago — and she is reeling from the effect.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's been an interesting week guys," she shared on her podcast. "This is the first time it's ever happened to me in my professional life that I lost a job this week because of things that were said."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She added, "A job got taken away from me because I was speaking candidly and openly about sex in a humorous way on our friend's podcast. I basically got a job, that I already had, pulled from me because I was speaking openly about sex."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The single, working mother who shares an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>8-year-old daughter, Briar</a> with ex Hayden Christensen, is left speechless to say the least, and is quite literally “floored” by the loss of opportunity.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“A single mom, a woman, lost a job because they were being candid and honest and the subject was sex,” she said.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Paras Griffin/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The frank comments in question are from her sharing her favorite and least sex positions on an episode of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Women On Top podcast</a>, adding she enjoys being “manhandled” in the bedroom.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Making no bones about something that was intended to be “lighthearted” she clarified on her podcast, “First of all, I said it in a joking manner in the interview, like, 'Yeah, I wanna get fucking get manhandled.' Basically, it's like, OK, give control or take control in the bedroom, whatever.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Baffled” by the move, the O.C. alum admits the delivery could have been different, but she would never take back her words.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I haven't said anything inappropriate," Bilson persisted.
