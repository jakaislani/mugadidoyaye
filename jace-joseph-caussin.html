Know His Parents, Sister, Age, Net Worth,</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p><strong>Jace Joseph Caussin</strong>&nbsp;is one of them who got worldwide fame since birth. He is the son of <strong>Mike Caussin</strong>, whose real name is&nbsp;<strong>Michael Caussin</strong>. He was a professional American football tight end with the Buffalo Bills, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Washington Redskins.</p><p><strong>Jace Joseph Caussin</strong>&nbsp;was born on <i>November 29, 2018</i>, in the United States of America to Mike Caussin and&nbsp;<strong>Jana Kramer</strong>, an American music singer, actress, dancer, and writer. Moreover, he is the younger brother of&nbsp;<strong>Jolie Rae Caussin&nbsp;</strong>( born on <i>January 31, 2016</i>). <strong>Martin Kramer</strong> is his maternal grandfather, whereas <strong>Nora Kramer</strong> is his maternal grandmother. So far, <strong>Steve Kramer</strong> is his maternal uncle, who is a police officer by profession.</p><h2>Jace Joseph Caussin's Parent's (Mike And Jana) Marital Life</h2><p>Jace Joseph Caussin's dad, Mike Caussin, and mom,&nbsp;<a href=#>Jana Kramer</a>, were happily married. The couple met through Twitter and started their conversations. And eventually, they fell for each other and started dating in <i>August 2014</i>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/9/15/5b7eeffd6414f987e2755d80%20(1)-1631692901091.jpg><p>Soon after four months of dating, the lovebirds engaged on <i>December 2, 2014</i>, i.e., on Kramer's 31st birthday. Then on <i>May 22, 2015</i>, the girlfriend-boyfriend duo got hitched in the presence of their close ones.</p><p>They were living a healthy life with their daughter, Jolie, but sadly, they separated because Mike Caussin cheated on Jana, and he was also sent into rehab for s*x addiction.

As a result, they split in the following month (<i>August 2010</i>) and filed for divorce, finalized in <i>June 2011</i>.</p><p>Again the American actress found her love in <strong>Brantley Gilbert</strong> (musician) in <i>2012</i>, with whom she met in <i>June 2012</i> during CMT Music Awards.
