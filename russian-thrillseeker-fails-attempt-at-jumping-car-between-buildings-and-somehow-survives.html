They put their lives on the line for our entertainment, and we want to see them fail as much as we want them to succeed. A <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Russian</a></strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">stuntman</a></strong> did the former with a car and, by some crazy happenstance, did not die.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=249 data-current-count=249 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a> reported on what they’re calling a “Car stunt gone wrong,” and boy, is that one way to put it. The stuntman’s name is Evgeny Chebotarev, and in the video, we see him speeding up a ramp in a Russian SUV called a Lada Niva.</p><p data-characters=230 data-current-count=479 data-injectable=true>He wanted to fly the car from one roof to the other. He didn’t make it. He didn’t even get close to making it. The ramp was not even kind of enough runway to pick up the speed he needed. How did anyone let him do this?</p><p data-characters=183 data-current-count=183 data-injectable=false>The car’s windshield hit the edge of the building before it went tumbling down seven-ish stories and exploded on the ground. The fall was violent. It’s very hard to watch.</p><p data-characters=199 data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false>It doesn’t look like a survivable fall. Crazily, Chebotarev crawls out of the wreckage like a baby calf being born to the cheers of his friends, who moments earlier thought he was gone forever.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-itemfix wp-block-embed-itemfix" data-current-count=682 data-injectable=true>via ItemFix</figure><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=315 data-injectable=false>He didn’t get off unscathed, though. He hurt his leg a little. He didn’t break it, but it did get bloody. Chebotarev, by the way, is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">no stranger to insane stunts</a>. He does backflips of ladders in the middle of the street, jumps over moving cars from moving cars, and honestly, he’s kind of the man.</p><p data-characters=69 data-current-count=384 data-injectable=false>Hopefully, he’ll be doing these crazy stunts well into old age.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmemnrGmu9Joqa6ro56ur3nToamipJyosqa3xKtkn5mZocBurdOtnKaopGKutXnJrqSpoZ6ceqSt0WaZnqynmrKvecGuoKWcmaO0tHnAp5tmq5%2Bisqm71maqrqqmnsOmv44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
