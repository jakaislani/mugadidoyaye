I just almost died (thinking about that). No, not ever, ever, ever, ever, ever. Like I’m signed with Justin, there’s not much more famous than him, like if I was going (to date someone for publicity) it would’ve happened if that was the case. First of all, he’s like (a) big brother (so) never, but I would never in a million years use anyone and people think that goes on a lot in Hollywood.”</p><p>Madison also doesn’t have anything to worry about with her romantic status, as she is currently dating Jack & Jack singer Jack Gilinsky.</p><p>The 18-year-old singer became a worldwide sensation when Sorry singer Justin tweeted a video of her singing when she was just 13. He later signed Madison to Island Records, and the star has gone on to enjoy a successful career. But despite the 23-year-old singer being responsible for her fame, their relationship will always stay strictly professional if Madison has anything to do with it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqKbZqaVq7KzecSvnKtllauys3nDmqueZZqqwLW1zWaZop2Smr9uucCdoKynnmKvprHRaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
