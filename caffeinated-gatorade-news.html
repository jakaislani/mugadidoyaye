No? Me neither. But imagine for a second that you just finished a workout and you are tired, sweaty, and thirsty. So you take a big ol’ swig of cold Gatorade. Now that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">deep-down body thirst</a> is quenched, which is great! But…you’re still tired and sweaty.</p><p>Well, Gatorade can’t help with the sweat, but soon they can help with the tiredness. The company just announced the upcoming release of their first ever caffeinated Gatorade. It’s called Fast Twitch, and it’s coming out early next year.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-so-what-flavors-will-the-caffeinated-gatorade-come-in-and-how-much-caffeine-does-it-contain>So what flavors will the caffeinated Gatorade come in? And how much caffeine does it contain?</h2><p>And, will Fast Twitch make me twitch fast???</p><p>Slow down there with the questions! What are you, drinking caffeinated Gatorade or something? It would seem that Gatorade Fast Twitch will come in six flavors: Cool Blue, Glacier Freeze (my personal favorite Gatorade flave), tropical mango, orange, strawberry watermelon, and strawberry lemonade. It’s non-carbonated, sugar-free, and contains a mix of B vitamins, electrolytes, and caffeine, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Food Business News</a>.</p><p>How much caffeine? Each bottle contains 200 mg, which is about as much caffeine as two cups of coffee. That’s less caffeine than a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Monster energy drink</a>, but still nothing to scoff at. If you’re a regular coffee drinker, you should be able to handle it just fine. But if you’re like me and only consume this amount of caffeine when you’re running on four hours of sleep or less, then I can almost guarantee you that it will make you twitch fast (for context, here’s some <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">actual footage</a> of me in this state).&nbsp;</p><p>While most of us won’t be able to get our hands on the stuff until early 2023, the NFL will be using it on the sidelines during the 2022-2023 season. Lucky them! It looks like this new product is part of Gatorade’s mission to cater to health-conscious athletes, who often avoid energy drinks due to the other ingredients they contain besides caffeine. Guess we’ll see if they make the fast switch to Fast Twitch come January!</p><p>And who knows, maybe someday Gatorade will solve the sweat issue, too, by making caffeinated Gatorade towels that absorb the sweat off your body while also quenching your thirst and giving you energy.&nbsp;Just an idea, Gatorade. Do with that what you will.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJuRm7Omtc2aq56cXZyutbvRmpueZZ6axLR7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
