I thought it was a flash-in-the-pan fad. I thought it would go the way of <a href=#>Crystal Pepsi</a> and the McDLT. But I was wrong. (I famously also thought the DVD was a stupid idea because the VHS was perfectly satisfactory.) Stuffed crust pizza not only stuck around in pizza joints, it also made its way to the frozen food aisle. And now that’s where we’re seeing even the most stuffed crust innovation. The newest creation: DiGiorno Thin & Crispy Stuffed Crust. Yes, it’s thin crust…but it’s stuffed! How is that even possible?&nbsp;</p><p>The brand is currently offering three flavors: Pepperoni & Sausage, Margherita, and Pepperoni, with Pepperoni with Mike’s Hot Honey arriving in freezers this June. We tried the Pepperoni & Sausage version to find out how this oxymoronic pizza crust is possible.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim" style=background-color:#bf653c></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="DiGiorno Thin & Crispy Stuffed Crust Pepperoni & Sausage" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/NPR_DIGIORNO-THIN-AND-CRISPY-STUFFED-CRUST-PIZZA_INSET.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">New DiGiorno Pizza!</p><strong>DiGiorno Thin & Crispy Stuffed Crust Pepperoni & Sausage</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>Please don’t hate me, but I’m not a huge stuffed crust person. I don’t like lots of goo in stuff. I especially don’t like it when lots of goo is hiding in stuff. So I was a little nervous about this new DiGiorno frozen pizza. But, as we learned when <a href=#>we tasted DiGiorno’s Thanksgiving pizza</a>, they really can do no wrong.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>I know you’re mostly interested in the crust, but first I must praise the sauce. DiGiorno <a href=#>pizza sauce</a> is kinda sweet a lot of the time, but not the sauce on this new pizza. It’s super savory and rich. The cheese on top of the pizza is thick, with a creamy flavor. And it doesn’t slide off the pizza—a feat for <a href=#>frozen pizza</a>. And the <a href=#>pepperoni</a> is not too thick, not too thin. And it’s not spicy (which is either a good or a bad thing, depending on who you are). Okay, onto the crust. It’s delicious. It’s flaky almost like pastry crust. And it’s filled with salty, melty, not-too-gooey cheese—I’d say a slim <a href=#>string cheese’s</a> worth. If you’re craving an explosion of melted cheese, this won’t satisfy you. But if crust typically bores you, this will keep you interested—especially dipped in some <a href=#>marinara sauce</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>DiGiorno makes some of the <a href=#>best thin crust frozen pizza</a>, but this thin crust isn’t like their signature thin crust at all. It’s nowhere near as crackery and crisp. Yes, it’s thinner than a traditional crust, but it’s not thin crust pizza as we think of it.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaKaVrHqltcaipqumn2K9qsbZmmStoJmjeqK6w2aaq6GjpcZuv9OunZ%2BdlGKws8HSrWSrnaaesrh7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
