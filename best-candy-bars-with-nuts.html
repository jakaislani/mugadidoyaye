Nuts have protein. They have good fat. Ergo, nut candy bars are the more responsible type of candy bar to eat. But really, it’s all about flavor, obviously. Some folks want to get nutty. They love that combo of sweet sugar and crunchy nuts. And they are right to love that mix of flavors and textures. Sugar plus nuts equals good. But some candy bars with nuts are better than others.&nbsp;</p><p>We tasted 18 different candy bars with nuts for this ranking, from chocolate candy bars with nuts like classic Snickers and shockingly still in production Hershey’s Symphony, to old-school chocolate-free nut candy bars like Payday and Munch. While none of the candy bars we tried were bad, five of them stood above the rest as must-try, must-eat, must-love candy bars with nuts. These highlighted the nuts in a way that elevated them. These are the nut candy bars that will truly satisfy the nut-lovers out there.&nbsp;</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="toblerone bar" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/BEST_NUTTY_CANDY_BAR_INSET_05.jpg-.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><strong>Best Salty</strong>-Sweet</p><strong>Toblerone Crunchy Salted Almond</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a><p>The other nut candy bars on this list mostly feature whole nuts, but this one is all about desiccated almond bits. Even though they’re small, they are the stars of the bar. The salty, nutty flavor and little pops of crunch contrast against the creamy milk chocolate. It’s complex and satisfying and the chocolate is so silky in that European chocolate kind of way. Plus, who doesn’t love eating a tiny pyramid of chocolate? Toblerone isn’t just for the airport. And this version is one of the best chocolate bars with nuts out there.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Amazon</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="lindt chocolate hazelnut bar" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BEST_NUTTY_CANDY_BAR_INSET_04.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><strong>Best Hazelnut</strong></p><strong>Lindt Whole Hazelnuts</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walgreens</a><p>Not to be confused with the Lindt Hazelnut Milk Chocolate, which is more of a classic chocolate bar with little bits of hazelnuts, this long, thin bar is studded with full, crunchy, buttery, round hazelnuts. They are big nuts and they are cloaked in creamy, slightly fruity milk chocolate and surrounded by a hazelnut filling. The only downside is that it is small. So, I guess you’ll just have to buy two. It’s one of the best chocolate candy bars with nuts for hazelnut lovers.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Walgreens</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="munch peanut bar" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BEST_NUTTY_CANDY_BAR_INSET_03.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><strong>Best No Chocolate</strong></p><strong>Munch Peanut Bar</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walmart</a><p>Upon first glance you might think this candy bar with nuts came from someone’s <a href=#>doomsday bunker</a>. It looks like something you can only buy on eBay. And yet, it is available and regularly restocked at stores like Walmart. The package advertises the fact that it’s gluten-free with no artificial ingredients and that it’s a low glycemic index snack. All of that might lead you to believe that it’s not very tempting. But this peanut brittle bar is really, really good. The candy is rich and buttery. And the peanuts are nice and roasty.&nbsp; It’s very crunchy; it shatters when you break it. If you’ve ever thought, “I love Cracker Jack, but I wish there wasn’t all this popcorn getting in the way of the good stuff,” you will love this nut candy bar.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="snickers bar" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BEST_NUTTY_CANDY_BAR_INSET_02.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><strong>Best with Nougat</strong></p><strong>Snickers</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>It seems boring to put Snickers at the top of this list, but there’s just nothing wrong with Snickers. Snickers are some of the best candy bars with nuts out there and they deserve to be recognized for their achievements. It’s a great combo of crunchy peanuts, soft nougat, gooey caramel, and a creamy chocolate coating. If I had to quibble I’d say the chocolate could be more chocolatey. But if you haven’t had a Snickers in a while and you’re craving a candy bar with nuts (peanuts, specifically), head to pretty much any check-out aisle or vending machine and grab a Snickers bar.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="chocolate payday" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BEST_NUTTY_CANDY_BAR_INSET_011.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size"><strong>Best of the Best</strong></p><strong>Chocolate Payday</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walmart</a><p>I’ve always thought Paydays were pretty good, but there was something missing: chocolate. So I was delighted to find out that Chocolate Payday existed. The peanut clusters are big and salty and nutty. The caramel is chewy and rich. And it’s all cloaked in a coating of milk chocolate. It’s a major upgrade to the original Payday bar and it’s the best candy bar with nuts we tasted. Seek it out if you’re craving some nutty, crunchy sweetness.&nbsp;</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><p><strong>Other candy bars with nuts we tried: </strong>Payday, Zero, Baby Ruth, Hershey’s Mr. Goodbar, Lindt Hazelnut Milk Chocolate, Almond Joy, Cadbury Dairy Milk Fruit & Nut, Choceur Dark Chocolate with Almonds, Choceur Milk Chocolate with Almonds, Moser Roth Dark Orange Almond, Toblerone Swiss Dark Chocolate with Honey and Almond Nougat, Hershey’s Milk Chocolate with Whole Almonds, Hershey’s Symphony Extra Creamy Milk Chocolate Almonds and Toffee</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFur8Cnm7Jlkpa%2FtHnWoquhZZ6qwbR7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
