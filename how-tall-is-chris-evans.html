Starting his career in 1997, for more than two decades Evans has showcased his range and ability to rise to an opportunity manning the lead role in Marvel’s Captain America series.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=248 data-current-count=248 data-injectable=false>The move into action films would begin in the mid-2000s but prior to this Evans had shown his comedic chops and charisma with appearances in the Fox-produced teen drama Biodiversity: Wild About Life!
