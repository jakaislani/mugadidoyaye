That number is a far cry from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Money, Inc.</a>‘s estimate, which puts his net worth at $20 million.</p><p data-characters=368 data-current-count=368 data-injectable=false>Much of Hochstein’s wealth has come from his business as a plastic surgeon, and he’s well known in Florida for his work. The self-proclaimed “Boob God,” who <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">trademarked that nickname</a>, by the way, specializes in breast enhancements and other esthetic procedures like facial rejuvenation and body contouring at his Miami clinic, Hochstein MedSpa.</p><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=720 data-injectable=true>His <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">clinic website</a> states that Hochstein has “performed over 27,000 breast augmentations, revisions, lifts, and reductions” so far in his career. In fact, he even <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">performed corrective surgery</a> on Lisa Hochstein, which the RHOM star hinted at in her season 4 tagline, “My husband built the perfect wife, and I built the perfect life.”</p><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=348 data-injectable=false>The perfect life didn’t last for the Hochsteins, though, and Dr. Lenny filed for divorce on May 23, 2022, a week after announcing their split. The plastic surgeon cited “irreconcilable differences” as the reason for the breakup and said their 12-year marriage was “irretrievably broken,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a> reported at the time.</p><p data-characters=473 data-current-count=821 data-injectable=true>Since then, the couple has been engaged in a messy public divorce, a lot of it involving money. In January 2023, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a> obtained new court documents filed by Lenny Hochstein in which he accused his estranged wife of “monotonous and repetitive requests” seeking “excessive temporary support money.” He claimed she was refusing to vacate their Star Island mansion and was driving “luxury vehicles including a Range Rover and a Rolls-Royce.”</p><p data-characters=523 data-current-count=523 data-injectable=true>He argued that he’d already spent $455,000 on household expenses for the RHOM star and the two children they share, contrary to Lisa Hochstein’s claims that she could not afford to buy food or diapers. Another court filing obtained by the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">publication</a> showed that the Hochsteins agreed to cap Lisa Hochstein’s spending on her American Express card to $5,000 a month, covered by the plastic surgeon. In addition, he said he wrote his estranged wife two checks for $12,500 each on November 23 and December 1.</p><p data-characters=178 data-current-count=178 data-injectable=false>As their divorce rages on, Real Housewives of Miami fans will have to tune back in to see if Dr. Lenny Hochstein’s net worth is impacted by his eventual divorce settlement.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZKKrXaGyr7rYZp%2Bom5iowaa1zaxkp52kYsSwvtOhZLCgkal6pbvErGSloaOWeqm7wqGqrZ2Zo8Busddmn66rkpa7pXnDqGSfp6JixLC%2Bymg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
