In fact, some fans are saying the show is using overt profanity as a way to mask weak storytelling and just a generally lackluster show.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=158 data-current-count=158 data-injectable=false>Over on r/witcher, fans are calling out the series’ penchant for using the f-word repeatedly for no real reason other than trying too hard. Take a look:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=458 data-injectable=true><a href=#>2 Episodes, 2 lines composed of several F bombs.</a> from <a href=#>witcher</a></figure><p data-characters=132 data-current-count=132 data-injectable=false>User Ierax29 made fun of the whole thing by pointing out Netflix’s seeming desperation to have a show as good as the original.</p><p data-characters=183 data-current-count=315 data-injectable=false>“Netflix : So we’ve heard you like Geralt saying “f**k,” they said. User BhataktiAtma responded with “How the f**k do you do, f**king fellow kids?”</p><p data-characters=127 data-current-count=442 data-injectable=true>This is of course a reference to the famous 30 Rock scene where Steve Buscemi’s character pretends to be a high schooler.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=198 data-current-count=498 data-injectable=true>Someone else said “It’s like the South Park episode when TV execs go overboard with ‘s**t.'” That episode was more a parody of Hollywood though, whereas Blood Origin is not.</p><p data-characters=115 data-current-count=115 data-injectable=false>Others pointed out that it’s like they add the word in front of literally f**king everything. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Some examples</a>:</p><p data-characters=214 data-current-count=329 data-injectable=false>“The f**king winds f**king howling,” “You were always an unruly f**king child. I f**king adored that about you. F**k” and “and then ciri screams FU**KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK.” Fun!</p><p data-characters=94 data-current-count=423 data-injectable=true>A separate thread also pointed out the dialogue, calling it “embarrassingly bad.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>The dialogues in Blood Origin are embarrassingly bad.</a> from <a href=#>witcher</a></figure><p data-characters=271 data-current-count=571 data-injectable=true>They also have some issues with other aspects of the show. A big one is making Eredin Bréacc Glas, the King of the Wild Hunt, a sexual being which is fine, but it became a plot point and that’s weird considering he’s the most terrifying villain in the games.</p><p data-characters=184 data-current-count=184 data-injectable=false>User Pumpkin_Tiny pointed out how incredibly out of character it would be for Eredin to use excessive profanity with Geralt after their big fight in the game Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt.</p><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=491 data-injectable=true>User Processing_Info pointed out that Eredin is so out of character in Blood Origin that he would be “too busy banging his boyfriend” to curse out Geralt. While this may sound offensive on its surface, the main issue is not that Eredin is gay but that he has a love interest in the first place.</p><p data-characters=89 data-current-count=89 data-injectable=false>Sure, it adds more to the character but is that really the context we need for a bad guy?</p><p data-characters=138 data-current-count=227 data-injectable=false>“It’s even worse than a porn parody,” user <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">jonomarkono said</a>. This is by no means the only negative sentiment out there.</p><p data-characters=181 data-current-count=408 data-injectable=true>In a post on the Witcher deep discussion subreddit <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">r/wiedzmin</a>, user High-On-Cinema broke down why Blood Origin is being received so terribly, in addition to the ridiculous dialogue.</p><p>“Oh my god, why are they doing this to us? … It’s like the writers said a big f**k off to any existing Witcher lore and what they came up with themselves was complete bullcrap. Leaving the crappy plot and story aside, none, I repeat, none of the characters are worth remembering or leave any impact on the viewers.”</p><p data-characters=165 data-current-count=507 data-injectable=false>I think it’s fair to say Blood Origin isn’t a fan favorite. For those ready to hear a barrage of f-bombs, Blood Origin is currently streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9OhnGavmamwqbHRZp2apqNiuqK3xGagrWWTobKivoytn5qsXZe5sLvDZqaroZeeu27A1KuloqaXYsGpsYyaoKtlkqHCpnnIrKWtZZKetG670WaapZ2mmr9w</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVib - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
